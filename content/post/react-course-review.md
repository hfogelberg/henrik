I decided it was time to finally learn The Big Thing of the year: React. After a bit of googling I came upon Stephen Grider - a highly active instructor on Udemy, who's created several well recieved courses, mainly concerning Javascript. Obviously he tesches React and React Native. I settled for [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/). Like most Udemy courses the pricing is a bit strange. The standard price is 180â‚¬, but there's almost always some sale going on. If there isn't, just wait a week and there will be.

The course is massive, with around 20 hours of videos. Stephen is a meticulous instructor and covers everything in great detail. He doesn't just describe how to do things, but also why and how it works. If you have a background in JS and web development and follow along you will most certainly be able to develop in React after finishing the course. I might very well buy more of his courses. He is a good instructor and has clearly put in a lot of work in preparing it.

On the negative, I found the pace a bit too slow and talky at times. There are a lot of repeats of the difficult part. To me, this is a bit unnecessary. After all, it is an online course. If I don't understand a part I could just rewatch it.

## So What About React?
My first impression is skepticism. React is a big step forward compared to Angular, but I still don't think they've nailed it. Setting up a new project from scratch is a nightmare. There are thousands of React starters Github and these days an official CLI. Still, it just shouldn't have to be this complicated! With the complication is the stability issue. If something breaks in this long chain of dependencies, then what?
