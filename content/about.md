I am a seasoned developer with a 20+ years of the IT industry. I've been tinkering with a bit of everything, but have spent most of my time writing code. My prefered stack at the moment is:

- A Mac to code on
- and VS code for my editor
- usually I pick either Golang 
- or Node.JS 
- and use Vue.js for SPA:s. So much easier than React!
- I use Mongo Db for storage
- or PostgreSQL when that is a better fit.
- I style it with SCSS (much more readable than SASS)
- and to turn the site in to a PWA while I'm at it.
