I am a seasoned developer, currently living on the beautiful island of Tenerife. I've worked for 20+ years in the IT industry, mostly as a developer, but have been tinkering with a bit of everything.

I've been in contact with a bunch of different languages, tools and hardware obviously, but my current prefered setup is:

- A Mac to code on
- and VS code for my editor
- usually I pick either Golang 
- or Node.JS 
- and use Vue.js for SPA:s. So much easier than React!
- I use Mongo Db for storage
- or PostgreSQL when that is a better fit.
- I style it with SCSS (much more readable than SASS)
- and to turn the site in to a PWA while I'm at it.
