Google Places Autocomplete has been a life saver for me many a time. Itâ€™s so powerful and easy to use! Plug it in, write half a dozen lines of code. Done. And it works so well it almost seems read my mind. Most of the time I just need to type three or four characters and can pick the location I want.
