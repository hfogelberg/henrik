<p>I have a long broad and long experience of the IT industry and have been programming on pretty much everything from AS/400:s to the iPhone. I've been doing .NET development since the first beta came ten years ago or so.</p>
<p>I consider myself to be a full stack developer, but prefer the backend stuff and us Go as my tool of choise.</p>
<p>Aside from coding I have practical experience of technical project management, testing, business process analyses, requirements, architecture, etc.</p>
<p>Currently I work for Ifrågasätt - a south Swedish startup, specializing in building tools for digital media. Our vision is to make it possible to have troll- and hate fress discussions on the Internet.</p>
