A couple of years ago new frontend Javascript frameworks started popping up more or less every day. The web was full of sites comparing and describing how to write the obligatory Todo-list using this, that and the other framework and us poor devs became more and more confused, bewildered and frustrated. 

One day the dust cleared and we just had two candidates for the final shoot out: Angular and React. Angular made the HUGE tactical mistake by admitting that they were working on Angular 2, which would be more or less a complete rewrite and hardly anything would work the same way as before. Naturally everybody flocked to React.

However the drama is not quite over. A small, one man rebel began appearing in tweets and blog posts: Vue js. More and more people started swearing by it and a pretty big site like Gitlab announced that they were building their frontend in Vue.

As a notorious early adapter I of course had to check it out and was blown away! Everything was so much easier and more natural than React and Angular! It just seemed so right. I had been struggling a lot, trying to like React, but honestly couldn't. Every step of the way I stumbled around in too much boiler plate code and confusing naming. Vue is much more straight forward and natural every step of the way and with a growing, active and helpful community to back.

It just has one disadvantage: the corporate adaption. Many devs love it and use Vue for personal side projects, but the corporate adaption is slow. There are of course companies and potential clients using it, but they are very few compared to React.
