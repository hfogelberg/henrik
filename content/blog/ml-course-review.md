One morning I woke up realising that I had, again, missed the train. I was a dinosaur, condemned to work in the past. Or perhaps jobless for ever?

Machine learning and artificial intelligence are the hottest subjects right now and there is no going back. What especially ML is about is handling huge amounts of data and making them useful is some way. It could be making suggestions, filtering out information, grouping data in a meaningful way or making predictions. And I had no clue where to even start.

Being a Udemy addict I headed over there to (a) see what they had and (b) check if they where on sale. Udemy has a strange pricing policy. The regular prices are so high for most courses that hardly anybody buys them. However they have more or less everything on offer more or less every month. If you can just wait for a week or two the 200€ course you want will most likely be available for 10 or 15€ instead. I was in luck. There was a sale on and loads of courses. 

## Machine Learning A-Z Review
I checked the comments and settled for one of the top sellers, [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/) by SuperDataScience Team. The course is huge, with 40 hours of videos, reading material and other external resources. It had thousands of reviews with a 4.5 star average. It had to be good! The content is both available i R and Python, the two most popular ML languages at the moment. I settled for Python, since I know it a bit and prefer a more general purpose language. 

There's a huge amount of information in the course, but unfortunately I am not completely happy with it. My problem is that I didn't really learn why I was doing what I was. It felt more like a copy-paste session than in depth learning. Python has good packages for doing ML, for instance Pandas, Numpy and Scikit Learn. However these are never really introduced - they're just thrown in and I didn't really understood which library did what or why. Finally I decided to skip the course and look for another. Perhaps I'll pick it up again later. Maybe I'd like it better if I knew what I was doing and why. 

## Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp
Instead I picked bought [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) by José Portilla. Sale again, a few weeks later. José's approach is very different. Instead of jumping in at the deep end he works methodically through the tools to be used, covering Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn etc before doing any actual ML. I though he spent a bit took long on the various ways to generate nice diagrams and skipped a few sections for now. You are many hours in to the 21 hour course before you do any kind of actual ML. However when you do get there you know the tools and can understand the training and testing much better. You don't just follow along like a parrot, which I felt I was doing in the other class.

The approach might not be liked by the very impatient, but it suited me. With this course I really understand and don't just do stuff! It doesn't cover quite as many ML algorithms as ML A-Z, but I think it will be easy to increase the toolkit as long as you have a solid foundation. Perhaps it's time to go back and watch it again? After all 10.000+ people can't be that wrong!
