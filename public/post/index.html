						<div class="post-summary"><p>You know the situation: you&rsquo;re building a web site where the user needs to log in to reach some (most?) of the pages. So, how do check if they are logged in? I a smooth, easily manageable way of course. The answer in Go is to use middleware. There are a few different ways to do it in, but after a bit of googling and some trial and error this is the way I tend to do it.</p></div>

Anyway, it was time for me to start looking at Tensorflow and obviuosly I wanted to use it in Jupyter. This turned out to be a bit of a struggle and it took a few hours of Googling before I got it to work.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>I&rsquo;ve mainly been hosting my personal projects on Heroku the last few years. The good news is that it&rsquo;s reliable and easy to use. The bad news is the price. The free plan has always had the limitation of the deployment going to sleep after some time without any traffic. The time before going to sleep has now dropped to 30 minutes and with a wake-up time of up to 10 seconds it isn&rsquo;t really usable.</p></div>

							<h4 class="post-date">Sep 20, 2017</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Ever so often I end up copy-pasting small code functions. This is OK, but it is a bit tedious and in pretty much every web project it&rsquo;s the same handfull of functions I use. So I just dumped them in a package called TooGo (Tools for Go )and they are ready to plug in. Currently there isn&rsquo;t very much in it, but the idea is to keep it growing and add more features as I come up with more useful snippets.</p></div>

							<h4 class="post-date">Sep 16, 2017</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>As a bit of a hobby I am learning the basics of machine learning. Quite a common way of getting data to work with is web scraping. So obviously it was time to figure out how to do it in Go.
It turned out to be really easy thanks to the excellent package goQuery.
The whole idea behind goQuery is to mimic jQuery, but -obviously- in Golang. I haven&rsquo;t used much jQuery the last few years, but felt at home quickly and thanks to the good docs it didn&rsquo;t take long to build a simple app.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Ever so often I have a 4 Mb digital photo that I want to use on a web site. Obviously a 4 Mb image on a web site isn&rsquo;t such a good idea. I could of course open the image in some photo editing program, but a simple command line app that did the job would be nice. Hmmm, perhaps I could write one myself in Go?
It turned out that I could and it wasn&rsquo;t a very big job either.</p></div>

							<h4 class="post-date">Aug 19, 2017</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>The sample code for the tutorial is available on Github.
Years ago when I first came in contact with Oauth it seemed like magic. I just plugged it in and didn’t think too much about what was going on and why. The truth is that there is no magic involved and it really is quite simple.
There are several packages around for Oauth in Golang, for instance Goth. However if you want to reinvent the wheel and build a version of your own from the ground up it really is quite straight forward.</p></div>

							<h4 class="post-date">Jul 25, 2017</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>If you’re a startup, an indie developer or just working on some side project in Vue JS, chances are that you will be thinking of using Firebase for storage. This might very well be a good idea: Firebase is really easy to use and has quite a generous free plan. Of course nothing is completely free. If whatever you are working on does take off it could get expensive. But that’s perhaps a bit of a luxury problem.</p></div>

							<h4 class="post-date">Jul 21, 2017</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>One stumbling block when I first started using Vue was figuring out how to run a Node server in the same project as an application written in Vue JS. I searched all over the net but couldn’t really find anything and ended up with the code in two different projects. That’s fine of course, but I just felt it was a bit unaesthetic and messy. So the search continued!</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>One morning I woke up realising that I had, again, missed the train. I was a dinosaur, condemned to work in the past. Or perhaps jobless for ever?
Machine learning and artificial intelligence are the hottest subjects right now and there is no going back. What especially ML is about is handling huge amounts of data and making them useful is some way. It could be making suggestions, filtering out information, grouping data in a meaningful way or making predictions.</p></div>
