<p>I decided it was time to finally learn The Big Thing of the year: React. After a bit of googling I came upon Stephen Grider - a highly active instructor on Udemy, who&rsquo;s created several well recieved courses, mainly concerning Javascript. Obviously he tesches React and React Native. I settled for <a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/">Modern React with Redux</a>. Like most Udemy courses the pricing is a bit strange. The standard price is 180â‚¬, but there&rsquo;s almost always some sale going on. If there isn&rsquo;t, just wait a week and there will be.</p>

<p>The course is massive, with around 20 hours of videos. Stephen is a meticulous instructor and covers everything in great detail. He doesn&rsquo;t just describe how to do things, but also why and how it works. If you have a background in JS and web development and follow along you will most certainly be able to develop in React after finishing the course. I might very well buy more of his courses. He is a good instructor and has clearly put in a lot of work in preparing it.</p>

<p>On the negative, I found the pace a bit too slow and talky at times. There are a lot of repeats of the difficult part. To me, this is a bit unnecessary. After all, it is an online course. If I don&rsquo;t understand a part I could just rewatch it.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-about-react">So What About React?</h2>

<p>My first impression is skepticism. React is a big step forward compared to Angular, but I still don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve nailed it. Setting up a new project from scratch is a nightmare. There are thousands of React starters Github and these days an official CLI. Still, it just shouldn&rsquo;t have to be this complicated! With the complication is the stability issue. If something breaks in this long chain of dependencies, then what?</p>
