      <description>When I first tried React a couple of years ago it was a nightmare setting up a new project. You either had a full dayâ€™s job ahead of you doing it from scratch or googled for a starter kit on Github. Finding the right one could of course require a full day too, since everyone who was in to React had a couple of different versions lying around, ever so often with messed up dependencies.</description>
