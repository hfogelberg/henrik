      <description>When I first tried React a couple of years ago it was a nightmare setting up a new project. You either had a full day’s job ahead of you doing it from scratch or googled for a starter kit on Github. Finding the right one could of course require a full day too, since everyone who was in to React had a couple of different versions lying around, ever so often with messed up dependencies.</description>

      <description>Google Places Autocomplete has been a life saver for me many a time. It’s so powerful and easy to use! Plug it in, write half a dozen lines of code. Done. And it works so well it almost seems read my mind. Most of the time I just need to type three or four characters and can pick the location I want.</description>
