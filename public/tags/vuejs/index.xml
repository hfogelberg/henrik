      <description>If you’re a startup, an indie developer or just working on some side project in Vue JS, chances are that you will be thinking of using Firebase for storage. This might very well be a good idea: Firebase is really easy to use and has quite a generous free plan. Of course nothing is completely free. If whatever you are working on does take off it could get expensive. But that’s perhaps a bit of a luxury problem.</description>

      <description>One stumbling block when I first started using Vue was figuring out how to run a Node server in the same project as an application written in Vue JS. I searched all over the net but couldn’t really find anything and ended up with the code in two different projects. That’s fine of course, but I just felt it was a bit unaesthetic and messy. So the search continued!</description>
