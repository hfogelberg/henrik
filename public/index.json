[{"categories":null,"contents":"When I first tried React a couple of years ago it was a nightmare setting up a new project. You either had a full day’s job ahead of you doing it from scratch or googled for a starter kit on Github. Finding the right one could of course require a full day too, since everyone who was in to React had a couple of different versions lying around, ever so often with messed up dependencies.\n","permalink":"/publications/react-parcel/","tags":["React","Parcel","JS"],"title":"Lean React Project With Parcel"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Google Places Autocomplete has been a life saver for me many a time. It’s so powerful and easy to use! Plug it in, write half a dozen lines of code. Done. And it works so well it almost seems read my mind. Most of the time I just need to type three or four characters and can pick the location I want.\n","permalink":"/publications/vue-google-places/","tags":["Google Places","Vue","JS"],"title":"Google Places Autocomplete in Vue"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Years ago when I first came in contact with Oauth it just seemed like magic.

This might very well be a good idea: Firebase is really easy to use and has quite a generous free plan. Of course nothing is completely free. If whatever you are working on does take off it could get expensive. But that’s perhaps a bit of a luxury problem.\n","permalink":"/publications/vue-firebase-ui/","tags":["VueJS","Firebase"],"title":"Authenticating a Vue JS Application With Firebase UI"},{"categories":null,"contents":"One stumbling block when I first started using Vue was figuring out how to run a Node server in the same project as an application written in Vue JS. I searched all over the net but couldn’t really find anything and ended up with the code in two different projects. That’s fine of course, but I just felt it was a bit unaesthetic and messy. So the search continued!\n","permalink":"/publications/vue-react/","tags":["VueJS","NodeJS"],"title":"Vue JS: Simultaneously Running Express and Webpack Dev Server"}]
